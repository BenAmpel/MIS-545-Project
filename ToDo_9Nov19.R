## Before Binding ##

# re-order columns as needed
# check for outliers
# commit to github (once after initial pass-through and again after final tidying)
# create new Rscript for merging
# review that NAs were handled and inserted correctly
# ensure all variables are of correct types
# rename folder on github to source data - raw, and then create a new folder 'processed' data, also 'analyzed', 'figures', etc.


## After Binding##

# remove Id columns
# cremove the ungroup() function in lapTimes and pitTimes that groups by raceId and driverId
# convert variables to appropriate types if necessary (e.g. factor)
